## About Me

I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University. I previously studied Statistics at the University of Iowa (BS '18, MS '19). I then worked for a few years as a Biostatistician at the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) at the Medical College of Wisconsin.

My research interests include Bayesian statistics, probability, and statistical computing and graphics.
