## About Me
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '25%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\blj12\\OneDrive\\STAT Website\\Website\\headshot1.jpg")
```

I am a first-year PhD student in Statistics at Iowa State University. I have previously earned my BS and MS in Statistics from the University of Iowa. I then worked for a few years as a Biostatistician at the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) at the Medical College of Wisconsin.

My research interests include Bayesian statistics, probability, and statistical computing and graphics.

## To Do List

There's a lot left to do in building this site. I need to:

* Get a more recent picture

* Add a footer claiming copyright maybe. I'm pretty sure that has legal standing without filing any paperwork with the gov't

* Once it's presentable enough then I need to figure out how to put it on Netlify
